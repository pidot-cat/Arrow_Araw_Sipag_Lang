## 🎯 Core Gameplay Mechanics

- **Straight Arrow Puzzle** — Each arrow occupies a straight horizontal or vertical run of grid cells. Tap arrows in the correct order to slide them off the board.
- **Escape Direction** — Each arrow has an `escape` direction (up/down/left/right). It can only slide out if its path to the grid edge is unobstructed by remaining arrows.
- **Tap Debouncing** — Arrows currently mid-animation are locked (`_pendingSolve` set) and cannot be re-tapped, preventing accidental rapid-tap life loss.
- **Solve Order** — Any arrow whose escape path is clear may be tapped. Tapping an arrow with a blocked path costs a life.
- **Lives System** — 3 lives per level. Wrong taps deduct 1 life each. Timer expiry ends the game immediately.
- **60-Second Timer** — Complete every level within 60 seconds. The HUD shows a linear depleting progress bar that turns red when ≤ 10 seconds remain.
- **HUD Layout** — `[Back ←] [Level N] · · · [♥♥♥] [Xs] [⚙]` followed by a colour-coded progress bar.

### 🔒 Level Locking & Progression

- New accounts unlock **Level 1 only**.
- Levels 2–10 display a lock icon until unlocked.
- Clearing a level triggers an **unlock animation** for the next level.
- Clearing **all 10 levels** permanently unlocks free selection across all levels (**Master Unlock** via `LevelUnlockService.instance.unlockAll()`).
- Progress is dual-stored: SharedPreferences (local/instant) + Supabase `level_progress` table (remote/cross-device).

## 🔊 Audio System

| Sound File | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `assets/audio/Lobby-Music.mp3` | Menu / lobby background music (loops) |
| `assets/audio/Ingame-Music.mp3` | In-game background music (loops) |
| Arrow sound | Correct arrow tap — slides out |
| Wrong-move sound | Wrong tap / blocked arrow — life deducted |
| Win sound | Level victory |
| Lose sound | Game over (lives = 0 **only**) |

**Idle Resume** — `AudioService.startIdleResumeTimer()` resumes game music 2 seconds after the last tap (preventing music stopping mid-play).

**Settings Modal** (in Settings Screen) provides functional toggles for:
- 🎵 **Background Music** — pause/resume `Lobby-Music` & `Ingame-Music`
- 🔊 **Sound FX** — mute/unmute all SFX (Arrow, Wrong Move, Win, Lose)

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

### Sign Up
1. Fill in Username, Password, Confirm Password, and Email.
2. Tap **Send** to receive a 6-digit OTP code via email.
3. Enter the code and tap **Sign Up** to create your account.
4. New accounts start at **Level 1** with zero stats.

### Forgot Password
1. **Step 1** — Enter your registered email address.
2. **Step 2** — Enter the 6-digit OTP code sent to your email.
3. **Step 3** — Set and confirm your new password.
4. Redirects back to Login upon success.

### Account Deletion (Hard Delete)
- Permanently removes the user from **Supabase Auth** (via `delete_user` RPC) AND all public tables (`game_stats`, `level_progress`, `records`, `history`).
- Local SharedPreferences are wiped.
- Re-registering with the same email **starts as a completely fresh user** (Level 1, zero stats).

## 📊 Records Screen

Displays accurate stats synced from Supabase:

| Stat | Description |
|---|---|
| Wins | Total levels successfully cleared |
| Losses | Total game-overs (lives = 0 or timer expired) |
| Matches | Total games played (Wins + Losses) |
| Win Rate % | `(Wins / Matches) × 100` |
| Days Active | Calendar days the app has been used |

All stat rows are compact (**max-height: 60dp**) with reduced padding for a professional look.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Logic

### Arrow Data Models
- **`BentCell`** — A single grid cell `(row, col)`.
- **`BentArrowData`** — Multi-segment arrow. Holds an ordered list of `BentCell` positions, an `escape` direction, a colour, and a `solved` flag. Exposes `hitRect(cellSize)` for tap detection with an extended hit zone in the escape direction.
- **`BentArrowPainter`** — Type alias for `StraightArrowPainter` (kept for backward compatibility).

### Core Engine (`BentLevelStateMixin`)
Mixed into every level screen. Responsibilities:
- **Timer** — 60-second countdown via `Timer.periodic`; calls `triggerGameOver()` at zero.
- **Tap handling** — `onGridTap` / `onTap` → `_findTappedArrow` → `isPathClear` → animate or `wrongTap`.
- **Debouncing** — `_pendingSolve` (a `Set<int>`) prevents re-tapping an arrow already in its 380 ms slide-out animation.
- **Victory / Game Over** — `triggerVictory()` records the result via `GameProvider` and calls `LevelUnlockService`; `triggerGameOver()` records a loss.
- **Navigation** — Back button leads to `LevelSelectScreen` (not Home).

### Painter Logic (`StraightArrowPainter`)
- Draws a **straight line** from the tail cell centre to a tip point `0.45 × cellSize` beyond the head in the escape direction.
- Renders a glow pass (blurred, semi-transparent) behind the crisp shaft.
- Arrowhead is a **closed filled triangle** (`Path..close()`) — no stray line artefacts.
- `hitTest` returns `false` so tap detection is delegated to `BentArrowData.hitRect` instead.

### Arrow Generation (`level_manager.dart` — `_gen`)
Three-pass algorithm:
1. **Pass 1** — Scans every cell; tries horizontal then vertical placement with a cycling length pattern `[2,3,4,5,2,3,2,4,3,5]`.
2. **Pass 2** — Fills remaining quota with length-2 horizontal arrows.
3. **Pass 3** — Fills remaining quota with length-2 vertical arrows.

Escape direction heuristic: arrows touching the left/right edge point outward; interior arrows point toward the nearer edge.

### Collision Detection (`isPathClear`)
Builds a set of occupied cells (all unsolved arrows except the tapped one), then walks from the arrow's head in the escape direction to the grid boundary. Returns `false` on first occupied cell found.

### State Management
Provider pattern. `GameProvider` tracks grid state and statistics; `AuthProvider` manages Supabase authentication.

### Data Persistence
- **Cloud**: Stats and level progress stored in Supabase (`game_stats`, `level_progress` tables).
- **Local**: SharedPreferences for fast local session handling and offline progress.

## 🗄️ Supabase Schema

### Required Tables

```sql
-- Game statistics
create table game_stats (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid references auth.users(id) on delete cascade,
  total_wins int default 0,
  total_losses int default 0,
  total_matches int default 0,
  total_days int default 1,
  updated_at timestamptz default now()
);

-- Level progress (unlock state)
create table level_progress (
  user_id uuid primary key references auth.users(id) on delete cascade,
  highest_unlocked_level int default 1,
  updated_at timestamptz default now()
);
```

### Required RPC (for hard account delete)

```sql
create or replace function delete_user()
returns void language plpgsql security definer as $$
begin
  delete from auth.users where id = auth.uid();
end;
$$;
```
