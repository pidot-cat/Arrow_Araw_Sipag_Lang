## 🎯 Core Gameplay Mechanics

- **Bent Arrow Puzzle** — Each arrow follows an L-shaped or straight path through the grid. Tap arrows in the correct order to slide them off the board.
- **Solve Order** — Arrows are numbered 0→N and must be cleared in sequence. Tapping the wrong one costs a life.
- **Escape Direction** — Each arrow has an `escape` direction (up/down/left/right). It can only slide out if its path is unblocked by remaining arrows.
- **Lives System** — 3 lives per level. Wrong taps or blocked moves deduct 1 life each. Timer expiry ends the game immediately.
- **Sound Logic** — Wrong-move sound (`Wrong Move-Sound.mp3`) plays on every bad tap. Game-over sound (`Lose-Sound.mp3`) plays **only** when lives reach zero.
- **60-Second Timer** — Complete every level within 60 seconds. The HUD shows a linear depleting progress bar.
- **HUD Layout** — `[Back ←] [Level N] · · · [♥♥♥] [Xs] [Progress Bar]`

### 🔒 Level Locking & Progression

- New accounts unlock **Level 1 only**.
- Levels 2–10 display a lock icon until unlocked.
- Clearing a level triggers an **unlock animation** for the next level.
- Clearing **all 10 levels** permanently unlocks free selection across all levels (**Master Unlock**).
- Progress is dual-stored: SharedPreferences (local/instant) + Supabase `level_progress` table (remote/cross-device).

## 🔊 Audio System

| Sound File | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `assets/sounds/Lobby-Music.mp3` | Menu / lobby background music (loops) |
| `assets/sounds/Ingame-Music.mp3` | In-game background music (loops) |
| `assets/sounds/Arrow-Sound.mp3` | Correct arrow tap — slides out |
| `assets/sounds/Wrong Move-Sound.mp3` | Wrong tap / blocked arrow — life deducted |
| `assets/sounds/Win-Sound.mp3` | Level victory |
| `assets/sounds/Lose-Sound.mp3` | Game over (lives = 0 **only**) |

**Settings Modal** (in Settings Screen) provides functional toggles for:
- 🎵 **Background Music** — pause/resume `Lobby-Music` & `Ingame-Music`
- 🔊 **Sound FX** — mute/unmute all SFX (Arrow, Wrong Move, Win, Lose)

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

### Sign Up
1. Fill in Username, Password, Confirm Password, and Email.
2. Tap **Send** to receive a 6-digit OTP code via email.
3. Enter the code and tap **Sign Up** to create your account.
4. New accounts start at **Level 1** with zero stats.

### Forgot Password
1. **Step 1** — Enter your registered email address.
2. **Step 2** — Enter the 6-digit OTP code sent to your email.
3. **Step 3** — Set and confirm your new password.
4. Redirects back to Login upon success.

### Account Deletion (Hard Delete)
- Permanently removes the user from **Supabase Auth** (via `delete_user` RPC) AND all public tables (`game_stats`, `level_progress`, `records`, `history`).
- Local SharedPreferences are wiped.
- Re-registering with the same email **starts as a completely fresh user** (Level 1, zero stats).

## 📊 Records Screen

Displays accurate stats synced from Supabase:

| Stat | Description |
|---|---|
| Wins | Total levels successfully cleared |
| Losses | Total game-overs (lives = 0 or timer expired) |
| Matches | Total games played (Wins + Losses) |
| Win Rate % | `(Wins / Matches) × 100` |
| Days Active | Calendar days the app has been used |

All stat rows are compact (**max-height: 60dp**) with reduced padding for a professional look.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Logic

### Arrow Data Models
- **`ArrowData`** — Legacy straight-line arrows (kept for backward compatibility).
- **`BentArrowData`** — Multi-segment bent arrows. Each arrow holds an ordered list of `BentCell` grid positions and an `escape` direction.

### HUD (Head-Up Display)
```

```
- Back button exits to Level Select.
- Hearts show remaining lives (red = alive, outline = lost).
- Timer digit turns red when ≤ 10 seconds remain.
- Linear progress bar depletes from full to empty over 60 seconds.

### Collision Detection
On tap, the engine:
1. Checks if the tapped arrow is the **next expected ID** in sequence.
2. Scans the escape path for blocking arrows.
3. **If blocked** → deduct 1 life, play `Wrong Move-Sound.mp3`. If lives = 0 → game over (plays `Lose-Sound.mp3`).
4. **If clear** → trigger slide-out animation, play `Arrow-Sound.mp3`. Zero life penalty.

### Painter Logic (`BentArrowPainter`)
- Draws the arrow shaft as a polyline through cell centers.
- **L-bend rendering**: consecutive cells differing in both row and column get a right-angle corner (horizontal-first).
- No tail dot — single-point fallback removed for a clean look.

### State Management
Provider pattern. `GameProvider` handles grid state and statistics; `AuthProvider` manages Supabase authentication.

### Data Persistence
- **Cloud**: High scores and profiles stored in Supabase (`game_stats`, `level_progress` tables).
- **Local**: SharedPreferences for fast local session handling and offline progress.

## 🗄️ Supabase Schema

### Required Tables

```sql
-- Game statistics
create table game_stats (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid references auth.users(id) on delete cascade,
  total_wins int default 0,
  total_losses int default 0,
  total_matches int default 0,
  total_days int default 1,
  updated_at timestamptz default now()
);

-- Level progress (unlock state)
create table level_progress (
  user_id uuid primary key references auth.users(id) on delete cascade,
  highest_unlocked_level int default 1,
  updated_at timestamptz default now()
);
```

### Required RPC (for hard account delete)

```sql
create or replace function delete_user()
returns void language plpgsql security definer as $$
begin
  delete from auth.users where id = auth.uid();
end;
$$;
```
