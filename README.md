🛠️ Technology Stack
Framework: Flutter (Dart) 

Backend: Supabase 

State Management: Provider 

Animations: Flutter Animate 

Audio: Audioplayers 

Design: Figma & Canva 

🏗️ Architecture & Logic
State Management
The app utilizes the Provider Pattern to separate business logic from the UI. GameProvider handles the grid state and statistics, while AuthProvider manages the secure connection to Supabase.

Data Persistence
Cloud Storage: High scores and profiles are stored in Supabase.

Local Storage: SharedPreferences is used for fast local session handling.
